<b>Starting the game</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
After the map size, game parameters and character look is chosen, the
game starts on &quot;holy ground&quot; where health regenerates
faster and no monsters can enter.</p>
<p>
There is a chest nearby containing:</p>
<p>
&gt; a pickaxe - a tool to break rock to gain stone resource</p>
<p>
&gt; an axe - a tool to chop trees, mushrooms and cacti to gain wood
resource</p>
<p>
(!) Be careful, it's the only axe you can get after starting the
game. If you have turned on any difficulty mode that removes your
inventory on death your game will become nearly unplayable if you
loose an axe. Always try to keep a spare axe to survive after
respawn.</p>
<p>
&gt; a random piece of armor</p>
<p>
&gt; a carpenter's workbench - a workbench used to craft all other
workbenches and furniture.</p>
<p>
(!) Be careful, the same note about the axe applies here. If you
loose carpenter's workbench on death it's nearly impossible to get a
new one or other workbenches, so be sure to place it at once. Any
free grass space near the holy ground would do.</p>
<p>
&gt; a bed - used to restore fatigue</p>
<p>
&gt; a chalk - used to stop monsters from following you.</p>
<p>
&gt; a random decoration tunica - does nothing, just for outfit.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
There is also a pathway down to the cave here.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Using inventory</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Press inventory key (&quot;i&quot;) to access the inventory.</p>
<p>
Use right-left buttons to move through inventory pages:</p>
<p>
1 - list of equipped items</p>
<p>
2 - list of equippable items</p>
<p>
3 - list of consumable food and potions</p>
<p>
4 - list of miscellaneous items, such as furniture, spellbooks,
torches and etc.</p>
<p>
5 - quantity of available resources</p>
<p>
6 - list of equipped decoration items</p>
<p>
You can equip/consume/place/use the item by pressing &quot;e&quot;.</p>
<p>
You can drop the item by pressing &quot;b&quot;</p>
<p>
You can see the item information by pressing &quot;i&quot;</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
As you attack your weapon gets damaged, as you take damage, your
armor takes damage. You can see the remaining quality of items in the
inventory. At 0% state items disappear.</p>
<p>
Spellbooks and scrolls of repair can repair a piece of your
equipment.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Equip your axe and a piece of armor and you're ready to go on.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Fighting</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
As soon as you've left the holy ground, monsters will attack you.
Beware of orcs at lvl.0 and watch for your health. To attack a
monster you have to &quot;walk into it&quot;.</p>
<p>
To shoot an enemy with your magic weapon press &quot;f&quot; and
choose direction to shoot.</p>
<p>
Killed enemies sometimes leave loot. If enemy's level is equal or
higher than the player character's level then XP is gained after
killing it.</p>
<p>
Snakes and some other monsters can cause poison/bleeding on your
character. It stops health from regenerating. Some other monsters and
traps can blind (you can't see anything), immobilize (you can't
move), hex (you get tired/hungry/thirsty much faster) your character.</p>
<p>
Don't haste and be careful. Ideally you should fight no more than one
enemy at a time and always have an &quot;escape plan&quot; in case
the battle goes badly wrong.</p>
<p>
Sometimes you can gain advantage by shooting enemies through the
places they cannot access, e.g. standing on the holy ground or
shooting snakes over water. You can also fight orcs from the holy
ground that'd make your health regenerate much faster and will give
you an easy option to retreat.</p>
<p>
There are thivering enemies (such as nymphs, goblins) that can steal
your gem. To recover the gem you have to kill the thief and take the
gem back from the loot.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Level-up</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Once you've earned enough XP your character will level-up. You can
choose whether to increase 
</p>
<p>
&gt; Strength by 3 points (chance to hit enemy)</p>
<p>
&gt; Skill by 3 points (?chance to evade enemy attacks?)</p>
<p>
&gt; Power by 3 points (?chance to hit with magic weapon?)</p>
<p>
&gt; Will by 3 points (?chance to evade magic attacks?)</p>
<p>
&gt; Health by 1 point</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Gathering resources</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
To chop wood / break rock you should &quot;walk&quot; into it. Be
careful, chopping wood makes dryades angry.</p>
<p>
To interact with the tile you're standing on press &quot;e&quot;,
this way you can gather herbs, berries or pick up loot from the
enemy.</p>
<p>
If you have the furnace you can cook raw meat, berries, fish, crops,
etc. to make them edible or improve their food quality.</p>
<p>
To stay alive your character needs food, water and rest. Replenish
your hunger by eating berries, cooked meat, etc. Quench your thirst
by eating blue berries, blue mushrooms or drinking from water
sources. You can drink water from fountains and water. Be careful,
some fountains in the tomb/dungeon are poisonous!</p>
<p>
To rest you need to find/craft a bed an use it. Be careful, resting
consumes a lot of hunger and thirst so it's best to go to bed with at
least 70% of both.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
P.S. If you have no armor equipped you can swim over deep water.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Crafting</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
As soon as you've gathered enough wood you can start crafting. To
craft workbenches you'll need a carpenter's workbench. With it you
can (each item costs 10 wood):</p>
<p>
&gt; craft another carpenter's workbench if you decide to move
elsewhere.</p>
<p>
&gt; craft a carver's workbench - the most important workbench
because it crafts tools and armor from wood.</p>
<p>
&gt; craft a stonecutter's workbench - to craft items from stone.</p>
<p>
&gt; craft a forger's workbench - same as carver's workbench but can
craft items from ore, they're much better, but ore is hard to find in
the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>
&gt; craft an alchemist's workshop - can craft random potions from
herbs.</p>
<p>
&gt; craft a random piece of furniture (bed, chest, etc.)</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
First of all you should craft a carver's workbench</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
It allows you to craft (each item costs 5 wood):</p>
<p>
&gt; tools</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; fishing rod - used to catch fish. Stand in water and select
fishing rod from the inventory.</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; torch - useful to light up dark areas</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; axe - always keep a spare axe!</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; pickaxe</p>
<p>
&gt; Weapon</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; Melee weapon - craft a random melee weapon</p>
<p>
&gt;&gt; Magic weapon - craft a random magic/missile weapon</p>
<p>
&gt; Armor - select a piece of armor to craft</p>
<p>
&gt; Jewelry - produce a piece of jewelry: rings and amulets which
increase character's luck and protect from magic attacks</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Make a full set of wooden equipment and you're ready to take it on :)</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Explore</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
As soon as you're prepared, have a back-up axe lying on the floor,
you can explore the map.</p>
<p>
You can easily get wood in the overworld or stone in the cave. Pay
attention, that wooden pickaxe doesn't break solid stone, you'll have
to find a better one.</p>
<p>
In the overworld there is an entrance to the cave, dungeon and exit
to desert area (refers to version 2.1.2). In desert area there is an
entrance to the tomb.</p>
<p>
Dungeon and tomb are ~5 levels deep dungeon (with enemies becoming
stronger each level). The last level contains the strongest enemies
and the most valuable loot like heart-shaped crystals (+2 life points
permanently, up to 20), blue crystals (permanently increases
character's magic skills), life potions (+1 life points permanently,
up to 30?).</p>
<p>
Some areas like overworld and cave always remain the same. But some
areas are randomly generated each time you enter them (e.g. dungeon
or tomb).</p>
<p>
Any stairs down you build in the overworld leads down to the cave.</p>
<p>
There is an exit down to grotto from the cave, but you can build your
own stairs down in the cave... and who might know what will you
eventually discover...</p>
<p>
Some areas contain traders you can trade with, and some
dungeons/tombs have prisoners you can save.</p>
<p>
You can call map by entering game menu (ESC key) and choosing Map
option. 3x3 white box is your current location.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
P.S. Check options, if you haven't yet. You can set game to
turn-based or real-time modes there.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Discover new items</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Some items you find are very useful.</p>
<p>
Armor/weapon quality goes in the following sequence:</p>
<p>
* Wood - lowest quality</p>
<p>
* Tin</p>
<p>
* Copper</p>
<p>
* Steel</p>
<p>
* Titan</p>
<p>
* Magnicium - the most powerful items</p>
<p>
Among other notable items:</p>
<p>
Heart-shaped crystal - adds +2 life points permanently, but no more
than 20</p>
<p>
Life potion - adds +1 life points premanenly, no limit (?)</p>
<p>
Mysterious blue crystal - increases magic skills (?), but no more
than (?)</p>
<p>
Potion/scroll of healing - heals your character</p>
<p>
Potion of feeding/refreshing - replenishes your character's hunger or
thirst. Very useful, because they don't get spoiled as other food
items do.</p>
<p>
Scroll or Spellbook of return - teleports you to holy ground.
Life-saver in many situations.</p>
<p>
Enchanting dust - enchants your weapon up to +2 state.</p>
<p>
Spellbook of Identify - maybe, one of two most valuable item in-game.
Allows you to identify the items you loot without altar.</p>
<p>
Spellbook of Repair - second most valuable item. Allows you to repair
your equipment frequently.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
P.S. To use a spellbook you have to be in &quot;focused&quot; state.
As soon as you use a spellbook your character becomes &quot;unfocused&quot;
for some time preventing you from using spellbook again. Some traps
and monster attacks also can prevent character from focusing.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Altar</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Items you find in the world can be holy, normal and cursed. Items you
craft are always normal. Items can be either &quot;enchanted&quot;
like wooden sword +3, or &quot;low-quality&quot; like titan spear -2.</p>
<p>
To identify items come to altar and press &quot;identify&quot;.</p>
<p>
You can also sacrifice items at altars, if they're good quality gods
will be pleased. Nice sacrifices increase your standing with gods and
allows you character to &quot;pray&quot; at altars. If gods'
disposition is high they will reward the character (by un-cursing his
equipment, healing, feeding, etc.). Otherwise they will curse
character's equipment.</p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Build</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
You can build different structures in most areas (overworld, desert,
cave, etc.) by pressing &quot;b&quot; key. The visual style of built
objects is defined by &quot;blueprint&quot; equipped. You start game
/ respawn with &quot;ordinary blueprint&quot;, but you can get more
as you explore. The build options (cycle with SPACE key) give you:</p>
<p>
&gt; wall - to protect you from monsters while you're asleep. This
builds a wall-box without entrance.</p>
<p>
&gt; floor - to make things comfortable</p>
<p>
&gt; door - to make entrance to the houses you build</p>
<p>
&gt; stairs up/down - to explore the world along z-axis :)</p>
<p>
&gt; agriculture - to grow crops and mushrooms</p>
<p>
&gt; And the last option gives you option to remove something you've
built.</p>
<p>
<br/>

<p>
<b>Hints &amp; tricks</b></p>
<p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
* Always carry a scroll of return in case of trouble.</p>
<p>
* Always make sure you have a spare axe lying on the ground or in a
chest.</p>
<p>
* Enter any dungeons or remote areas fully rested.</p>
<p>
* When exploring remote place it's a good idea to build a temporary
base at the entrance with a water/fountain and a bed nearby.</p>
<p>
* Always have some cooked and ready food at your base. You may return
very hungry.</p>
<p>
* Gems can be used to buy items from traders</p>
<p>
* Don't haste to equip unidentified items unless you're desperate.
They may be cursed and cannot be removed unless destroyed or curse
removed at altar. You might end up forced to wear an item you don't
want.</p>
<p>
* Throw away any unuseful items to make room for more loot in your
inventory.</p>
<p>
* Don't throw out nice items. Even if they're duplicate or you have
better ones. Make a storage room and stack them there.</p>
<p>
* Unequip armor to be capable of swimming over deep water, sometimes
this can save your life.</p>
<p>
* Until you have a spellbook of identify take notes of altars in the
dungeons. You can return there to identify your items and be able to
loot further.</p>
<p>
* Leave a spare axe near every location you enter. There is a tiny
chance you might get blocked by trees as they grow.</p>
<p>
* When your level is higher than max dungeon's monsters level there
is no XP gain from killing them all. Go deeper :)</p>
<p>
* Spawner creatures (necromancer, wisp) are overly dangerous. Often
it's better just to avoid them.</p>
<p>
* Retreat is almost always an option to dying. If you've though about
an escape route before you found yourself in a trouble.</p>
<p>
* It's better to smash vases from distance, because sometimes vase
monsters may surround you too tightly.</p>
<p>
* Entering inventory counts as a turn pass even if you don't make any
operations there. Be careful in a battle.</p>
<p>
* Spellbooks are more useful than scrolls because they have unlimited
uses. But scrolls have advantage that they don't need your character
to be focused to use. This is a critical advantage of scroll of
return and of healing scrolls/potions.</p>
<p>
* Keep an eye on your equipment state. You don't want to be left
without a primary weapon in a monster-infested dungeon.</p>
<p>
* Be careful. And have fun :)</p>
